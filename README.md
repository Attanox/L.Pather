# L.Pather

Branching from [`Leaflet.FreeDraw`](https://github.com/Wildhoney/Leaflet.FreeDraw), L.Pather is a freehand polyline creator that simplifies the polyline for mutability. The reason for creating a branch from `FreeDraw` is that a polyline feature would bloat `FreeDraw` unnecessarily, whilst diverging from `FreeDraw`'s original purpose for allowing geospatial queries.
